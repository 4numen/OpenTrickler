# How to Print?

Basic Settings

* 40% infill
* 5x top/bottom layers
* 4x walls
* 0.4~0.45mm wall width
* 0.2mm layer height
* No support needed

All parts are pre-oriented so you don't need to worry about that part. 



Material

* hopper_base: Any material you like except for soft stuff. 
* hopper_body: Translucent material like natural PETG or translucent PLA. 
* hopper_cap: TPU95a is recommended. But you can print it in any material you like. 
* rear_body_interface: Any hard material you like. 



## Special about hopper_body

The hopper_body is parameterized. You can scale the length of the body along Z axis to make it bigger. 

The hopper_body is recommended to print in VASE mode with 0.8mm single wall thickness to give you best translucent look and no Z seam.
