# Bearing pocket calibration? What is it?

The bearing pocket calibration is the file derived as a part of the front body. You can print this part and test fit with both 6804 and 608 bearings. 

* If you cannot insert the bearing to the pocket even with the help with bench top vise, you may need to re-calibrate your print for flow extrusion. Your flow is too high. 

* If the bearing is sitting loose in the pocket and can fall off, it means the printed part is under extruded. Still, you may need to re-calibrate your print for flow extrusion as your flow is too low.
