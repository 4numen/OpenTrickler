## Assemble Open Trickler Body

## Assemble A&D FX-120i/300i Weight Pan Adapter
### Overview
![weight_pan_adapter_overview.png](Resources/weight_pan_adapter_overview.png)

### Component Prep
This design relies heavily on heatset inserts. Make sure you have the proper inserts (check the hardware
reference for a close up picture and the BOM for dimensions).

### Assembly
Use 1x M3x6 BHCS to install the top part to the weight pan adapter. The screw should sit flush or 
below, more importantly, not extruding beyond the surface.
