===========

![cad_view](Resources/cad_view.PNG)

Inspired by the AutoTrickler v4, the OpenTrickler is designed be printed and assembled using common tools to build Voron printers.


BOM
---------

 * 8x M3 5x4mm heatset insert (the same Voron uses.
 * 8x M3x8 SHCS
 * 2x 608ZZ bearing
 * 2x 6804ZZ bearing
 * 2x NEMA17 (42mm) stepper motor. The size and torque doesn't really matter.
 * 4x M6x16 and nuts for mounting the trickler to the lid. 

Print settings
---------

 * Body Material: ABS/PETG/PLA you name it.
 * Belt: TPU 95A.
 * 4 walls, 5 tops and bottoms.
 * 0.2mm layer height, force 0.4mm line width and 0.24mm for the first layer.
 * 40% infill is recommended.

Print Orientation 
---------

Objects should lay flat if possible, otherwise, for example, the rotary tube should be printed in the stand position with chamfered side pointing downwards.

The printer need to be tuned at least for extruder e-stepts and flow as it has plastic to metal contact which requires certain tolerances.
